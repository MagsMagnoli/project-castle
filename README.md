# Project Castle üè∞

Project Castle is a community-driven initiative focused on fortifying the Dota 2 community through collaboration, support, and shared expertise.

### Scope

This project aims to minimize the barrier to entry for grassroots communities to run their own events. We hope to incorporate resources ranging from the full lifecycle of event planning to execution. Some example components include:

- Guids and tips for running a high quality stream setup
- Game State Integration (GSI) overlays for things like captains mode and in-game tooltips
- Financial document templates for running an event
- Itemized checklists for hosting online and offline events
- And more!
